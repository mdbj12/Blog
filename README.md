Welcome to my Blogging app!

Lately I've been into blogging my weeks on Medium where I post weekly updates on my life after graduating my Bootcamp
I want to use this as my platform to update weekly blogs where users can see my weekly blogs but also to add an extra functionality where my blogs will also be posted onto my Medium
This application was built using React.Js for the front end and Flask with Python in the backend

Cool things I want to implement:
- Three.Js

Basic features:
- I can log into my account and post blogs
- Users can open this web application and see my weekly blogs and interact with them via 'Likes', 'Comments' or 'Share' them to their friends

Feature goals:
- Users can create their own account to post their own blogs onto their accounts and also 'Like', 'Comment' and 'Share' their blogs as well

I will be hosting this through Vercel! I'll write down the website URL as soon as this project is hosted!
